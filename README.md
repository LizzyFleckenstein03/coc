Toy implementation of the [calculus of constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions).

TODO: Inductive types, Type universes.

See example.coc for examples.

See hurkens.coc for an implementation of Hurken's paradox, which is currently possible due to lack of type universes.

Usage: `lua coc.lua <file>`

Works in luajit.
